A very basic english/german translator build on tkinter.

this was made because I sometimes need to very quickly look up certain words or translate them into english/german. 

Because this is supposed to work quick for me you don't use your mouse at all, everything works through shortcuts.

**Note: This is supposed to run constantly in the background so it's not recommended to close it by closing the window. Instead use the shortcuts listed below to minimize the window**

## Shortcuts  
  
`ctrl+shift+t` - Brings up or minimizes the window (Note that while minimized the program is not visible in the taskbar)  
`Control-e` - Switches Languages from english/german or german/english  
`Control-d` - Brings up a separate window with the full definition of the translated word and closes it again  
`Control-s` - Brings up a complete list of all the synonyms of the translated word and closes it again  
`Escape` - Closes or minimizes the selected window
